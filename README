This jQuery plugin is a response handler and takes a data type and binds it to the response.

Use the css to control the look of the toaster. Check out the examples for usage.

In order to use the examples you will have to use PHP because I needed to pass headers with the HTTP response.

	* Create an example for the Data Grid response handler 

I'm using Google's Closure compiler to do the javascript minification/compiling and am including the shell script that I use. It does require that you include the compiler.jar
file or change the path to include it.

I haven't decided on any licensing as of yet, so just use it if you find it.
